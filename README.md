1. System requirements
- MATLAB (2018b or later version is recommended.)

- Installation of Deep Learning Toolbox

- Uploaded codes were tested using MATLAB 2018b and 2019b.

- Download pretrained AlexNet ('https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/59133-deep-learning-toolbox-model-for-alexnet-network')

- No non-standard hardware is required to run the codes.


2. Installation guide
- Download "Face_020820.zip" and unzip the file.

- Download "Dataset.zip", "View_dataset.zip" and unzip on same file.

- By running "Run.mlapp" and selecting figure option, you can perform a demo simulation using one network.


3. Demo and instructions for use
- When you run "Run.mlapp", you can choose figure option from 1 to 4.

- For all figure options, a demo simulation using one AlexNet will be performed and the results will be displayed.
  (Expected running time < 5 minutes for each figure)
